\section*{On the usage of the pronouns we and I}

Most of the research described in this thesis was highly collaborative.
I would like to thank deeply all my collaborators for their help, support, and thoughtful discussions.
In the writing, I hence use ``we'' for collaborative parts and ``I'' for the parts I have mostly done myself.
%To highlight the collaborative part of theis work, I use ``we'' for collaborative aspects and ``I'' for the parts I have done myself.




%The core research projects in this thesis were highly collaborative. Upon reflection, I feel both lucky and grateful for my collaborator’s contributions, efforts and support throughout the thesis. I have learned a lot from them and am greatly indebted to them. In recognition of the collaborative nature of this thesis, and for ease of reading, I thus use the pronoun ’we’ when describing collaborative parts of this thesis and use "I" when it is done by myself.
